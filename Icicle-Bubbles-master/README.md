Icicle Bubbles is a WebGL experience by Edan Kwan. <br>
Unlike traditional 3D metaball effect, it only blends the depth. <br>
Which means there is no transparency support but in that case there is no need to deal with the blocked mesh. <br>
For the light scattering effect, it is faked by the depth blend and the depth blur with upside/downside rendering. <br>
